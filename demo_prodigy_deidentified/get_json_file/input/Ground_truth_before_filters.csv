Subject Line Follow UpRoutine Neurology Consultation MD Referring MD Primary Dear Dr. MD I saw in the epilepsy unit today in a virtual visit. He is now 33 y.o. and presents To discuss management of sleep and for management of anticonvulsant medications . He is unaccompanied for this visit. Assessment and Plan 1. Partial seizure Assessment  Plan is doing well with good seizure control and a few side effects. Is concerned about his sleep given his recent purchase of a home and moved to with his girlfriend. There is increased stress associated with these new responsibilities. Asking about taking a hemp deriived CBD for sleep as well as about medical marijuana for sleep. He has been taking a hempCBD preparation that he feels has been very helpful for sleep. I told him that they are unlikely to be detrimental to his seizure control and if there really is a benefit on sleep then the net effect would be positive. However we dont provide medical marijuana letterscards so he will look for someone locally if he wants to pursue that route. He will continue his current strategy with regard to sleep since its been working. He also like to continue the current combination of zonisamide and levetiracetam. I can see him again in about a year if all goes well. Other orders  levETIRAcetam KEPPRA 500 MG tablet Dispense 405 tablet Refill 3 Problem detail. Interim history See below.

Z1,1,9/99/10000,NO,MGH Epilepsy Clinic M.D. Epilepsy Service Neurocritical Care Service Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Neurology CC  MD Dear I had the pleasure of seeing MRN  DOB  in Epilepsy Clinic today for chief complaint of seizures and traumatic brain injury. Ms. is an a 80 year old female with a history of HTN HLD DM and CKD who was an unrestrained driver in a motor vehicle accident in collision into pole with no airbag deployment head stroke face to steering unknown LOC. She was brought to the ED by EMS and enroute had a 20 second generalized seizure. Her imaging revealed right sulcal temporal SAH and smaller area of L posterior temporoparietal SAH. She was admitted the ICU and on serial imaging had blossoming of her right SAM and interval development of 5cm R temporal IPH. Her ICU course was complicated by resiratory failure requiring brief period of mechanical ventilation. She did not have any further clinical seizures or electrographic seizures. She was continued on Levetiracetam. Interval history Ms has been making a good recovery and is getting back close to her baseline. She has not had any episodes concerning for seizures. She did however have an episode of LOC a month ago at the rehab facility and was taken to. There were no witnessed convulsions and the likely diagnosis was thought to be syncope. In review of the events of her MVA it appears she was unrestrained and perhaps fell asleep in the car. Unclear if this could have been syncopal. She is continuing to take the Keppra without any adverse effects.  General review of systems was negative for fevers chills rashes change in weight energy level or appetite chest pain palpitations shortness of breath cough abdominal pain nausea vomiting and change in bowel or bladder habits i.e incontinence. All other systems reviewed were negative.

There is no history of smoking excessive ETOH intake or illicit drug use.  PHYSICAL EXAM  Vital Signs Blood pressure 12870 pulse 80 temperature 36.3 C 97.4 F temperature source Temporal height 157.5 cm 5 2 weight 59.9 kg 132 lb SpO2 98 .   General The patient appeared well developed and in no acute distress. Gastrointestinal The abdomen was soft and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds. Skin without any lesions.  Neuro The patient was fully alert and oriented and was following all commands and appropriately interactive. There was complete fluency without paraphasic errors. Visual fields were full to confrontation. Pupils were equal round and reactive to light. There was no ptosis and the extra occular movements were intact without nystagmus or saccadic breakdown. There was no facial asymmetry. The tongue and palate were midline. There was no dysarthria. The strength was 45 throughout including shoulder abduction flexion and extension at the elbows fingers hips knees as well as ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Sensation was diffusely intact to light touch. The deep tendon reflexes were diminished. Gait not assessed patient on stretcher  DATA    EEG  Left and right frontal sharp discharges from MRI   MRI images from the admission. There is a large right SAH stable on serial scans. There is a right temporal hematoma also stable on scans. In addition there is multifocal SAH Repeat CTH I reviewed CTH images and agree with the reported findings. Resolving SAH and edema.  ASSESSMENT and IMPRESSION   In summary Ms is a 80 year old female with an acute symptomatic seizure secondary to traumatic brain injury. She has not had any seizures since her discharge.We will obtain a routine EEG to guide risk stratification. She does not note any medication related adverse effects. Based on EEG results will review risk vs. Benefits for weaning off Keppra. We discussed that while her seizure recurrence risk is elevated due to the acute seizure as they only occurred during the immediate acute phase it is reasonable to consider weaning Keppra especially if she is having any adverse effects. Loss of consciousness  Episode one month ago per description likely syncopal vs. Hypoglycemia. Wil obtain discharge summary from . She may need additional syncope work up including cardiac monitor if not done recently. Recommend follow up with PCP. Epilepsy safety  measures including no driving within 6 months of a seizure or episode of lost consciousness showering rather than bathing medication compliance substance use avoidance and sleep hygeine were discussed.  Sincerely   M.D.
